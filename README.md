# week-2-passwordgen

This is my week two homework to generate a password given the paramaters of length, and what type of characters they would like to use.

There isn't really much to screenshot here. The css and html for this project were prebuilt, so it feels a little disigenuous to take  credit for them

I ended up building this project a few times. Not because it wasn't functional, but mainly to see what other ways I could do it. This is teh version I liked the most and
that I made first actually. Just with some minor tweaks to make the code look nicer and moce some variables around.
